        <h2>Description</h2>
        Chocolate Chip Muffins are my personal favorites! The sweetness of 
        the bread and the chocolate together makes my mouth water. The 
        specifics are mostly up to preference but here is a basic example.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 & 1/2 cups (315g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (13g) baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp (5g) baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp (2.5g) salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (114g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (250ml) buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (15ml) vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 cups (275g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Spray a 12 cup muffin tray with 
                non-stick cooking spray or line with paper liners.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, toss together the flour, baking powder, 
                baking soda, salt and chocolate chips. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sugar, 
                eggs, milk and vanilla. Slowly add to the dry ingredients. 
                Gently fold together until JUST combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter into the 12 muffin cups and bake at 425°F 
                for 5 minutes. Then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F 
                and continue to bake for another 12-15 minutes or until 
                a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 
                Do not overbake or the muffins will be dry. Let cool for 
                about 5-10 minutes and enjoy warm.</li>
        </ol>
